    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><em>The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is <br>filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole.<br> You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! <br>Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>â…” cup water</li>
        <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef,<br> breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell,<br>and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
    </ol>
